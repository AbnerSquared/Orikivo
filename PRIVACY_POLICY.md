# **Orikivo Arcade Privacy Policy**
> Last updated: January 6, 2021

By using **Orikivo Arcade**, you agree to the following privacy policy.

## What is collected?
**Orikivo Arcade** collects the following personal information from you:
- Your user ID
- Your username
- Your discriminator
- The time at which the account is created

These are used solely to help clarify and store accounts to a unique identifier. Your username and discriminator are used to display your name in varying commands, and are not used outside of that purpose. All user accounts are immediately created when a command that requires one is used.

### What about stats?
**Orikivo Arcade** does start to store extra data only relative to commands executed within the bot. This can include your inventory, balance, statistics related to the commands that you have executed, and cooldowns that keep track of when you last executed a command. This data is ONLY stored when you execute a command. Any trade offers that are sent from other users can only occur when you have already created an account.

**Orikivo Arcade** also collects the following information from guilds:
- The guild ID
- The guild name
- The guild owner ID
- The time at which the account is created

Guild accounts are created when any of the following commands are executed:<br/>
`guildoption`<br/>
`guildoptions`

The owner ID for a guild is stored to ensure that guild owners can execute specific commands that would otherwise be blocked to the user.
System role IDs is a configuration option that refers to the collection of roles that allow a user to execute commands. Other purposes include the default role a user receives when they join this guild. By default, this information is left empty, and must be manually entered by the guild owner.

## Who receives this data?
All data stored on the locally on the dedicated server. The stored data, aside from being used with **Orikivo Arcade**, is not sent to anyone.

## How can I get rid of my data?
If you wish to get rid of any personal data, you may do so by executing the command `erase`. Once confirmed, ALL of your data will be deleted from **Orikivo Arcade**.

### What about guild data?
To get rid of guild data, execute the command `guilderase`. After confirmation, **Orikivo Arcade** will erase all data related to that guild.

## I have concerns. Where can I go to talk about them?
