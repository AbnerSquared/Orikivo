By using **Orikivo Arcade**, you agree to the following privacy policy.

## Permanent Information Collected

**Orikivo Arcade** collects the following information from active users:
- ID
- Username
- Discriminator

**Orikivo Arcade** collects the following guild information:
- ID
- Name
- Owner ID
- System Role IDs [Empty by default]

All user accounts are immediately created when a command that requires one is used. Guild accounts are created when the bot joins.

These are used solely to help clarify and store accounts to a unique identifier.
Your username and discriminator are used to display your name in varying commands, and are not used outside of that purpose.
The owner ID for a guild is stored to ensure that guild owners can execute specific commands that would otherwise be blocked to the user.
System role IDs are referring to the collection of roles that allow a user to execute commands. Other purposes include the default role a user receives when they join a guild.
By default, this information is left empty, and must be manually entered by the guild owner.

This information is currently stored locally on a personal hosting computer.

## Who receives this data?
All data stored on the hosting computer is kept local. The stored data, aside from being used with **Orikivo Arcade**, is not sent to anyone.
