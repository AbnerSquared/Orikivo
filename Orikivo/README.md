# Orikivo
A Discord bot that is now discontinued, but provides plenty of core services to Arcadia. The main story arc and structure was intended to represent a fragment of an upcoming storyline that is planned.

## History
This bot has been in development for quite a long time. While one of the goals was to make some of the classes applicable to a possible future game framework, I wanted to create an RPG/Animal Crossing-esque kind of game system. This handles how items functions, map/world mechanics and travelling all around.
