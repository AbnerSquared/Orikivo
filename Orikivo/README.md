# Orikivo
An upcoming Discord.NET bot. The main story arc and structure represents a fragment of an upcoming game's story.

## Objectives
This bot has been in development for quite a long time. While one of the goals was to make some of the classes applicable to a possible future game framework, I wanted to create an RPG/Animal Crossing-esque kind of game system. This handles how items functions, map/world mechanics and travelling all around.

## Submitting Issues/Suggestions
As of now, I'm not focused on implementing new features or mechanics. I simply wish to touch up or optimize everything that does exist.
Whenever you submit an issue, try to make sure it fits any of the following questions:
- Is there already an existing function for a custom function made?
- Are there ways that a method can be optimized for speed?
- Does the code follow C# standards?
- Does it require an extension outside of System.*?
- Can a function be created to replace repetitive methods?
- Is there a better way to structure classes?
