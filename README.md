# Orikivo
A Discord.NET bot in development for over a year.

## Main Goals
I want this bot to be a new way to handle cooperative games across Discord. I also wanted a new way that user accounts were handled, taking a unique approach to what a user can do, such as having stats, merits, unique experience values for each field, and booster mechanics.

## Submitting Issues
Whenever you submit an issue, try to make sure it fits any of the following questions:
- Is there already an existing function for a custom function made?
- Are there ways that a method can be optimized for speed?
- Does the code follow C# standards?
- Does it require an extension outside of System.*?
- Can a function be created to replace repetitive methods?
