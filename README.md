## Contributing
Since this is my first time letting a project I've spent a while on go public, this might be a bit of a challenge for me. As of now, I will only accept contributions for issues that are explicitly marked with the tag `tag:up for grabs`. A StyleCop inclusion is currently planned in the future, but as of now, you can refer to a rough structure for how all code should look in `REFACTORING_GUIDELINES.md`. More will be fleshed out in the future in relation to this topic.
