# Orikivo
A Discord.NET bot in development for over a year.

## Main Goals
I want this bot to be a new way to handle cooperative games across Discord. I also wanted a new way that user accounts were handled, taking a unique approach to what a user can do, such as having stats, merits, unique experience values for each field, and booster mechanics.
